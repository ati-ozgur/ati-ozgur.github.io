I think java can be a very good first programming language if you start with first-rate tools. 

 - BlueJ http://www.bluej.org/
 - Greenfoot http://www.greenfoot.org/

Using these tools allows you to overcome  "public static void main" problem.
I follow something like following

- You start with objects first. In the first lesson, I teach fields and methods.
- Constructors
- Scope (private/public)
- static variables
...

I teach  "public static void main" more than 10-12 hours later as entry point of a Program, when you do not use BlueJ or Greenfoot.

I have successfully used simple and elegant IDE of BlueJ in more than 20 professional and 2 academic courses and I am satisfied by it.
