# There is no clear definition of Unified Namespace (UNS)

Most important thing I learned from reading this thesis is "there is no clear definition of Unified namespace"

In section, 3.3 The Unified Namespace:

> The term Unified namespace was popularized by Walker Reynolds, that created the first UNS project in 2005, and who is an avid supporter and spokesperson for the technology. 


The problem with above sections and UNS is that there is almost nothing to cite academically.
That is apart from some blog posts and videos, there is nothing which defines UNS concretely.
No technical reports, no books, no academic articles that define UNS.
When you look at the references of this thesis, this is clearly observed.


Below sentences actually summarize these very well.


> The exact definition of UNS is still not completely agreed upon, but UNS is a system or methodology where all entities, such as files, data or resources etc. are organized in a centralized repository of structured data. 


> Harrington (from HighByte) says that UNS is an ever-evolving concept. The definition and message that Walker Reynold gave just a few years ago has changed in the past years and will probably continue to do so. 

There is nothing wrong with evolving a definition actually definition should evolve but first a clear definition is needed.
