# Review of master thesis: The Impact of Unified Namespace in Industry 4.0


I have read following master thesis:

The Impact of Unified Namespace in Industry 4.0
ÁdámSamuel and Péter Werner 
Lund University
Department of Automatic Control
https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9174552/file/9174561.pdf


Thesis is 138 pages long.
They interviewed 3 manufacturing companies Sweden and also HighByte.
They also made a simulation of UNS but unfortunately simulation details are very lacking.

First 57 pages and 3 sections should be very familiar to people who are working on Industrial automation and have heard of UNS.
They explain common terms in UNS, IIoT, Artificial Intelligence, MQTT and so on.



I am summarizing some of the interesting sentences from the these part below.

3.1.2 Industrial Artificial Intelligence
This section is a good intro.



> Industrial AI can be categorized in six levels, where 0 represents the lack of AI and 5 is a fully autonomous system: (Peres, et al, 2020)
(Zohaib, et al., 2023)


>In order to tune [LLM] models, one needs an immense amount of data....
>This is a key reason for why LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but struggle in domain-specific tasks, which is what Industrial AI is trademarked as. 
...
>The availability of industrial data is very limited, as businesses generally are secretive with their processes and historically lack the infrastructure for useful data-handling and tracking, even for their own operations. 


3.3 The Unified Namespace

> The term Unified namespace was popularized by Walker Reynolds, that created the first UNS project in 2005, and who is an avid supporter and spokesperson for the technology. 


The problem with above sections and UNS is that there is almost nothing to cite academically.
That is apart from some blog posts and videos, there is nothing which defines UNS concretely.
No technical reports, no books, no academic articles that define UNS.

Below sentences actually summarize these very well.


> The exact definition of UNS is still not completely agreed upon, but UNS is a system or methodology where all entities, such as files, data or resources etc. are organized in a centralized repository of structured data. 


> Harrington (from HighByte) says that UNS is an ever-evolving concept. The definition and message that Walker Reynold gave just a few years ago has changed in the past years and will probably continue to do so. 

There is nothing wrong with evolving a definition but a clear definition is lacking.
