# Review of master thesis: The Impact of Unified Namespace in Industry 4.0

I have read following master thesis:

The Impact of Unified Namespace in Industry 4.0
by Ádám Samuel and Péter Werner 
Lund University
Department of Automatic Control

TLDR; 

1. There is no clear definition of UNS
2. ISA95 structure and single source of truth is the most useful parts of UNS.
3. MQTT is not always needed, OPC-UA is good enough for small to mid companies. Only after 100 connected devices advantages of MQTT will be seen.

## Short summary


Thesis is 138 pages long.
They interviewed 3 manufacturing companies Sweden and also HighByte.
They also made a simulation of Unified namespace (UNS) but unfortunately simulation details are very lacking and no code is given.

First 57 pages and 3 sections should be very familiar to people who are working on Industrial automation and have heard of UNS.
They explain common terms in UNS, IIoT, Artificial Intelligence, MQTT and so on.
Then, interviews are given and companies explain their experience with UNS.
Last, they give their conclusions.
